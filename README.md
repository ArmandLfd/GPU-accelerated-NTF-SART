## How it works
Use CMAKE to configure the project that you can lauch further with Visual Studio Code. This programs need a GPU, CUDA programming tool, OpenCV, and a C++ compiler. 

## How to launch it
Generate the executable files, then launch it via a terminal. One argument can be passed: the path to the parameter file.

## Parameter file
The parameter file should be in the same fom that the one provided: param1.txt
